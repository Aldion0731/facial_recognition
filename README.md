### PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Facial recognition is a biometric identification method that measures unique characteristics of a human
face. Applications available today include flight check in, tagging friends and family members in
photos, and “tailored” advertising. 
The objective of this project is to use Tensorflow and Keras to build a deep convolutional neural network to perform facial recognition 


Dataset Details:
The data for the project is a modified version the ORL face database and is composed of 400 images of size 112 x 92. There are 20 people, and 20 images per person. The dataset has been divided into a training set of 12 images per person, and a test set of 8 images per person. The images were taken at different times, lighting and facial expressions. The faces are in an upright position in frontal view, with a slight left-right rotation.
